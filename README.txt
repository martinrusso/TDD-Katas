==========Supermarket Pricing===========

##### Description #####
A supermarket has a lot of different ways in which products may be priced. Pricing each of these requires 
certain rules. In this Kata the requirements start off simple and new requirements are added later 
representing a realistic development lifecycle. To represent this, we recommend doing each step in order 
without reading ahead. 
Requirements 
##### Step 1 #####
Create a program which calculates the cost of buying different products at these prices. 
• Loaf of bread - $1 
• Noodles - $0.50 
• Soup cans - $2 
• Apples $2/
##### Step 2 #####
Add in functionality so that if a customer buys a certain number of a product they get another one 
for free. 
• Soup cans - buy 4 get 1 free 
##### Step 3 #####
Add in functionality so that buying a certain number of a product adjusts the total price of that set. 
• Noodles - 3 for $1
